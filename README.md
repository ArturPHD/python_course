# Practical Python: From Basics to Data Science and PyTorch

Welcome to the official repository for the "Practical Python" course. This course is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to Python programming, starting with the fundamentals and progressing to advanced topics in data analysis, big data principles with MapReduce, and deep learning with PyTorch.

## Course Overview

This is a hands-on course focused on practical application. The curriculum is divided into three main parts:

1.  **Python Fundamentals:** Core concepts of the Python language, including data structures, functions, and object-oriented programming.

2.  **Data Processing & Analysis:** Introduction to the MapReduce paradigm and essential data science libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

3.  **Deep Learning with PyTorch:** Building and training neural networks for real-world problems like image recognition.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should have:

* **Basic computer literacy:** You should be comfortable with file management and using a command line/terminal.

* **No prior programming experience is required.** We will start from the very beginning.

* A computer with at least 8GB of RAM.

* An internet connection to download necessary software and libraries.

## Getting Started: Environment Setup

Before our first class, please follow the setup instructions outlined in the `00-Setup-Environment` folder. You can either follow the step-by-step guide in the Jupyter Notebook or use the automated scripts to prepare your environment.
