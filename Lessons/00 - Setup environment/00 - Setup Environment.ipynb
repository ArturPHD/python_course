    "# Part 0: Setting Up Your Development Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the course! Before we dive into Python programming, it's crucial to set up a proper development environment. This ensures that you have all the necessary tools and that your code runs smoothly throughout the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will walk you through:\n",
    "1.  **Choosing an IDE** (Integrated Development Environment).\n",
    "2.  **Understanding GPU requirements** for the PyTorch section.\n",
    "3.  **Installing all necessary libraries** using an automated script."

    "## 1. Choosing Your IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. For this course, you can use any of the following. Choose the one that you feel most comfortable with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A) Visual Studio Code (Recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "VS Code is a free, lightweight, and highly extensible code editor. It's the most popular choice for general-purpose programming and has excellent support for Python and Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Download:** [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n",
    "* **Required Extensions:** After installing VS Code, you must install these two extensions from the Extensions Marketplace:\n",
    "    1.  **Python** (by Microsoft)\n",
    "    2.  **Jupyter** (by Microsoft)"

    "\n",
    "PyCharm is a powerful IDE specifically designed for Python. It has a free Community Edition that is more than sufficient for our course. It offers great features like code completion, debugging, and project management.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Download:** [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)\n",
    "* **Note:** Make sure you download the **Community** version, which is free."

    "### C) Google Colaboratory (Cloud-Based)\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Colab is a free, cloud-based Jupyter Notebook environment that runs entirely in your browser. It requires no setup and gives you free access to GPUs, which is a huge advantage for the deep learning part of our course.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Access:** [https://colab.research.google.com/](https://colab.research.google.com/)\n",
    "* **Pros:** No installation needed, free GPU access.\n",
    "* **Cons:** Requires a stable internet connection, can be slower for file management."

    "## 2. GPU and CUDA Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "For the final part of our course, we will be using **PyTorch** to train neural networks. This process can be accelerated significantly by using a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).\n",
    "\n",
    "### NVIDIA GPUs (Preferred)\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch is optimized to run on NVIDIA GPUs using a technology called **CUDA**. If you have a modern NVIDIA graphics card (GTX 1050 or newer is recommended), you will be able to train models much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **How to check:** On Windows, open the Task Manager (`Ctrl+Shift+Esc`), go to the \"Performance\" tab, and check for your GPU's name.\n",
    "* **Required Drivers:** Ensure you have the latest drivers installed from the [NVIDIA website](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx).\n",
    "\n",
    "### AMD GPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "Officially, PyTorch uses NVIDIA's CUDA. However, there are ways to run it on AMD GPUs using a compatibility layer called **ROCm**. The setup is more complex and depends heavily on your operating system (Linux is best supported).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Official Guide:** For advanced users, you can follow the official guide to install PyTorch with ROCm support: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally-rocm/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally-rocm/)\n",
    "* **Recommendation for AMD users:** The easiest path is to use **Google Colab**. It provides free access to powerful NVIDIA GPUs, bypassing any local hardware limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What if I don't have a supported GPU?\n",
    "\n",
    "No problem! You can still complete the entire course. PyTorch can run on your computer's CPU. Training will be slower, but for the models we'll be building, it will be perfectly manageable. And you can always use Google Colab for the more intensive tasks."

    "## 3. Installing Required Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "We have provided automated scripts to set up a virtual environment and install all the necessary libraries. A virtual environment is a self-contained directory that holds a specific Python interpreter and its own set of libraries, preventing conflicts between projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Download the repository files to your computer.\n",
    "2.  Unzip the folder.\n",
    "3.  **For Windows:** Double-click the `setup_environment.bat` file. A command prompt will appear and perform the installation.\n",
    "4.  **For macOS/Linux:** Open a terminal, navigate into the project folder (`cd path/to/your/folder`), and run the command: `bash setup_environment.sh`\n",
    "\n",
    "After the script finishes, a folder named `.venv` will be created. Your IDE (VS Code or PyCharm) should automatically detect this virtual environment and ask if you want to use it for the project. **You should agree.** This will ensure you are using the libraries we just installed."
