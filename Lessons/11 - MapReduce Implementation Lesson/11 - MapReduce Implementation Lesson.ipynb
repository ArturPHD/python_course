    "# Lesson 11: MapReduce Implementation in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous lesson, we discussed the theory behind MapReduce. Today, we're going to make it concrete by building a simple simulator in Python. This will help you understand the data flow and the roles of the `map` and `reduce` functions without the complexity of a real distributed system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create a reusable \"framework\" that handles the simulation, and then we will write `map` and `reduce` functions to solve two different problems:\n",
    "1. The classic **Word Count** problem.\n",
    "2. A more complex problem from a **Lithuanian state exam**, which involves scheduling and data aggregation."

    "## 1. Our Simulated MapReduce Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "We have created a Python file named `map_reduce_framework.py`. This file contains a single function, `run_map_reduce`, which simulates the entire process. Let's look at what it does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Takes Inputs**: It accepts an input file, a mapper function, a reducer function, and an output directory.\n",
    "2.  **Setup**: It creates the output directory and a subdirectory for intermediate files (`/intermediate`).\n",
    "3.  **Map Phase**: It reads the input file line by line, applies the `mapper` function to each line, and collects all the emitted `(key, value)` pairs. The result is saved to `intermediate/mapped_data.json`.\n",
    "4.  **Shuffle & Sort Phase**: It takes the list of mapped pairs and groups all values by their key into a dictionary. This crucial step is saved to `intermediate/shuffled_data.json`.\n",
    "5.  **Reduce Phase**: It iterates through the shuffled data, applying the `reducer` function to each key and its list of values. The final results are collected.\n",
    "6.  **Output**: The final results are saved to `results.json` in the specified output directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your job as a developer is to focus only on writing the `mapper` and `reducer` functions!**"

For each of these time slots, we need to output the day, hour, the number of friends, and an alphabetized list of their names. The final list of time slots should be sorted by the number of friends in descending order."

    "\n",
    "* **Reducer**: The reducer receives a time slot and a list of all associated events (e.g., `[('ROOM_SLOT', True), ('FRIEND', 'Vidas'), ('FRIEND', 'Rasa')]`). It checks if a `ROOM_SLOT` exists and counts the friends. If the count is greater than 3, it emits the final result for that time slot.\n",
