    "# Lesson 11: Implementing a MapReduce Simulator in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In our previous lesson, we covered the theory of MapReduce. Today, we'll put that theory into practice by building and using a simulator called `FakeMapReduce`. This framework includes a `DataLoader` and a `Job` driver, mirroring the architecture of real-world systems like Hadoop or Spark and providing a clear separation of concerns."

    "\n",
    "1.  **`DataLoader`**: Its sole responsibility is to read data from a source (in our case, a text file) and provide it to the framework record by record (line by line). This separates the data-reading logic from the data-processing logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **`Job` (The Job Driver)**: This is the main controller. It accepts your `DataLoader`, your `mapper` function, and your `reducer` function, and then it orchestrates the entire process:\n",
    "    * It requests data from the `DataLoader`.\n",
    "    * It runs the **Map** phase on each record.\n",
    "    * It performs the **Shuffle & Sort** phase, grouping intermediate data by key.\n",
    "    * It runs the **Reduce** phase for each unique key.\n",
    "    * It saves the intermediate and final results to files for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data flows as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input File** -> `DataLoader` -> `Job` -> `mapper` -> `Job` (Shuffle) -> `reducer` -> `Job` -> **Output Files**"
