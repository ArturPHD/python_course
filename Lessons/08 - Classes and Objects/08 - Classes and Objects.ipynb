    "Welcome to the world of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)! This is a fundamental programming paradigm that helps us structure our code in a way that is intuitive, reusable, and scalable. Instead of just writing procedures (functions), we start modeling our programs around real-world or abstract \"objects.\""

    "\n",
    "OOP allows us to bundle related data and the functions that operate on that data into a single unit called an **object**. For example, we can create a `Student` object that holds a student's name, ID, and GPA, along with functions to enroll them in a course or calculate their academic standing."
