    "\n",

    "## 1. Inheritance: The \"Is-A\" Relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create a new class (the **child class** or **subclass**) that inherits the attributes and methods of an existing class (the **parent class** or **superclass**).\n",
    "\n",
    "This models a real-world \"is-a\" relationship. For example:\n",
    "* A `Car` **is a** `Vehicle`.\n",
    "* A `Dog` **is an** `Animal`.\n",
    "* A `GraduateStudent` **is a** `Student`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use inheritance?**\n",
    "1.  **Code Reusability**: You can write common code once in the parent class and reuse it in multiple child classes. This is the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n",
    "2.  **Organization**: It creates a logical hierarchy of classes that is easier to understand and maintain.\n",
    "3.  **Extensibility**: You can add new, specific functionality to a child class without modifying the parent class.\n",
    "4.  **Polymorphism**: It allows us to treat objects of different classes that share a common parent as if they were of the same type."
